# hello_world
The hello world repo. Will probably use to test git related stuff (history management)

This is an edit. I am certain it will go gloriously.

An edit at home

A remote edit. Not at home

A potential merge conflict created at home (github already has an extra commit my home repo does not know about)

More remote chnages....
