# hello_world
The hello world repo. Will probably use to test git related stuff (history management)

This is an edit. I am certain it will go gloriously.

An edit at home

A remote edit. Not at home

(added after line bellow) Local change. There is a remote change pending to download. The idea is to test what happens if I try to pull or merge while having this change staged.... The merge aborted because of the staged changes. What if I unstage??. It also aborted. good stuff

A potential merge conflict created at home (github already has an extra commit my home repo does not know about)

More remote chnages....
